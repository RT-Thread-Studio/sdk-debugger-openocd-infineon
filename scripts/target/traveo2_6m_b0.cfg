# Configuration script for Cypress TRAVEO™II C-2D family of microcontrollers.
# TRAVEO™II C-2D is a triple-core device with CM0+ and 2xCM7 cores. All cores share
# the same Flash/RAM/MMIO address space.

# The following four lines can be used to override Flash Geometry of the target device
# In this case configuration scripts will not perform any auto-detection and will use
# predefined values.
# If all these variables are set to zero, configuration scripts will attempt to detect
# the type of target device by reading SiliconID from SFlash and matching it with MPN
# database, see cympn.cfg file.
